      <h2>Hi.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an aspiring Full-stack developer / Data scientist. who aims to <br>
        showcase and acquire more knowledge and skills in <br>
        programming and data analytics.

      <h2>What I am.</h2>
      <h4>Highly adaptive.</h4>
      <p>
        I am very much passionate about programming, may it be in the field <br>
        of web development or data analytics and others, I can easily adapt <br>
        myself to other languages that would be required of me.
      </p>
      <h4>Especially focused.</h4>
      <p>
        I have always been able to evaluate and prioritize my workload to <br>
        best determine what I can accomplish in a set period of time so I can <br>
        focus on a task, scheduling is my key ingredient.
      </p>
      <h4>Remarkably pro-active.</h4>
      <p>
        Instead of worrying about conditions over which I have little to <br>
        no control, instead I focus my time, attention and enegy on things <br>
        I can control. I think through scenarios, the big picture, <br>
        I prioritize, I prepare and make things happen.

          <h3>Programming.</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning to code 2 years ago, albeit I have been coding a couple of years before, unbeknownst to me.
            I was already modding my own video games before then and would take hours even days to finish up. Over time, I gained
            a passion for coding and wanted to pursue this line of career until it evolved to a more mature pursuit.

        <h3>Jogging.</h3>
        <p>
          This is one of my greatest pleasures in life. I could never go a week without taking a run.
          It calms my mind and boost my confidence about myself which is quite helpful since I'm an
          introvert at heart.

        I love keeping things easy. My objectives in any projects I come <br>
        across are to rely on clear composition, customized theme content <br>
        and interpreting the impression you really want to give.
